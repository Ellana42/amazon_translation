# Translation app from Japanese to English

These are two small translation apps from Japanese to English. main.py works in the command line and takes in japanese text as input (you can type python3 main.py --help for further information). gui.py is a small, quite straightforward user interface. 

I intend on updating this repository with downloadable .app programs.

You can test the program with the provided test_text.txt and test_output.txt files. The japanese input is an extract of one of my redactions, it therefore should not be considered  a good example of native japanese.
